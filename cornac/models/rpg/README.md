# RPG

Cornac implementation of **RPG** (Generating Long Semantic IDs in Parallel for
Recommendation, Hou et al., KDD 2025,
[arXiv:2506.05781](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.05781)). RPG represents each item
with a long, unordered Semantic ID produced by product quantization and predicts
all of the next item's Semantic-ID digits in parallel. This port follows the
[official implementation](https://github.com/facebookresearch/RPG_KDD2025) for
OPQ tokenization, causal-session training, the GPT-2 multi-token-prediction
(MTP) backbone, and similarity-graph-guided decoding.

## Requirements

RPG needs PyTorch, Transformers, FAISS, and scikit-learn:

```bash
pip install -r cornac/models/rpg/requirements.txt
```

The FAISS tokenizer uses 8-bit product quantization, so the supported
`codebook_size` is 256. Item content embeddings must cover every item known to
the train, validation, and test splits.

## Usage

Supply precomputed item content embeddings through a `FeatureModality`. Its
`features` rows must align with `ids` (see
[`examples/rpg_example.py`](../../../examples/rpg_example.py) for an end-to-end
example):

```python
from cornac.data import FeatureModality
from cornac.eval_methods import NextItemEvaluation
from cornac.models import RPG
from cornac.models.rpg import RPG_BEAUTY_CONFIG

eval_method = NextItemEvaluation.from_splits(
    train_data=train,
    val_data=val,
    test_data=test,
    mode="last",
    item_feature=FeatureModality(features=item_embeddings, ids=item_ids),
)

model = RPG(**{**RPG_BEAUTY_CONFIG, "device": "auto", "seed": 2024})
```

The paper uses 3072-dimensional OpenAI `text-embedding-3-large` item
embeddings, followed by whitened PCA to 512 dimensions. Other content
embeddings are accepted, but Semantic-ID quality and recommendation results
depend on them.

Constructor defaults provide a lighter training setup. Use `RPG_CONFIG` for
the official repository defaults or a per-dataset configuration for the
paper-best Amazon recipe:

| Config              |     LR | Temperature | Codebooks | Beams | Graph edges | Propagation steps |
| ------------------- | -----: | ----------: | --------: | ----: | ----------: | ----------------: |
| `RPG_CONFIG`        | 0.0003 |        0.07 |        32 |    50 |          50 |                 3 |
| `RPG_BEAUTY_CONFIG` |   0.01 |        0.03 |        32 |    20 |         200 |                 3 |
| `RPG_SPORTS_CONFIG` |  0.003 |        0.03 |        16 |   100 |          30 |                 5 |
| `RPG_TOYS_CONFIG`   |  0.003 |        0.03 |        16 |   200 |          20 |                 3 |

All shipped configurations use a maximum history length of 50, batch size 256,
AdamW, cosine scheduling with 10,000 warmup steps, and at most 150 epochs. The
validation NDCG@10 is evaluated every epoch in batches of 32; training stops
after 20 consecutive non-improving epochs and restores the best checkpoint.

## Training iteration

RPG does **not** expand a short session into independent prefix-target rows as
TIGER, LETTER, and SASRec do. For a session `[a, b, c, d]`, RPG creates one
causal training row:

```text
input:  [a, b, c, PAD, ...]
labels: [b, c, d, -100, ...]
```

The GPT-2 backbone produces a hidden state at every input position. Each valid
label contributes an MTP loss that predicts all Semantic-ID codebooks in
parallel; `-100` labels are ignored. Consequently, the three next-item targets
share one forward pass and one optimizer step.

For a session longer than `max_len + 1`, the first window supervises every
position. Later sliding windows supervise only their final position, ensuring
that every next-item target is counted exactly once. A session of length `T`
therefore produces `max(T - max_len, 1)` training rows, rather than `T - 1`
prefix rows.

## Scoring modes

- `scoring="graph"` follows the paper: it propagates a beam over a similarity
  graph built from item Semantic IDs and assigns real scores only to the final
  candidates. Set `n_beams` at least as large as the largest evaluation cutoff.
- `scoring="exact"` scores the full catalog by gathering and averaging the
  parallel per-codebook logits. It is useful as a deterministic diagnostic and
  for modest catalogs, but it is not the paper's retrieval path.

Both modes use the same trained model. On the Amazon experiments below, their
Recall/NDCG results differ by at most 0.0018 in absolute value.

## Results

Paper-style graph-decoding results on the three Amazon Reviews 2014 5-core
datasets:

| Dataset |  R@5 ours/paper |  N@5 ours/paper | R@10 ours/paper | N@10 ours/paper |
| ------- | --------------: | --------------: | --------------: | --------------: |
| Beauty  | 0.0533 / 0.0550 | 0.0372 / 0.0381 | 0.0789 / 0.0809 | 0.0454 / 0.0464 |
| Sports  | 0.0288 / 0.0314 | 0.0198 / 0.0216 | 0.0420 / 0.0463 | 0.0241 / 0.0263 |
| Toys    | 0.0613 / 0.0592 | 0.0415 / 0.0401 | 0.0898 / 0.0869 | 0.0506 / 0.0490 |

**Setting:** per-user leave-last-out (`train = sequence[:-2]`, validation target
= second-to-last, test target = last), `mode="last"`, `max_len=50`, and
`seed=123`. Items use the official RPG `text-embedding-3-large` embeddings.
Each category uses its per-dataset configuration above. Beauty and Sports are
within 3.1% and 8.3% of the paper's R@5, respectively; Toys is 3.5% higher.

### Graph versus exact scoring

| Dataset | Scoring |    R@5 |    N@5 |   R@10 |   N@10 |   R@20 |   N@20 |    MRR | Total (s) |
| ------- | ------- | -----: | -----: | -----: | -----: | -----: | -----: | -----: | --------: |
| Beauty  | graph   | 0.0533 | 0.0372 | 0.0789 | 0.0454 | 0.1113 | 0.0536 | 0.0380 |      2502 |
| Beauty  | exact   | 0.0534 | 0.0373 | 0.0798 | 0.0457 | 0.1125 | 0.0539 | 0.0412 |         — |
| Sports  | graph   | 0.0288 | 0.0198 | 0.0420 | 0.0241 | 0.0619 | 0.0291 | 0.0219 |      4095 |
| Sports  | exact   | 0.0291 | 0.0201 | 0.0428 | 0.0245 | 0.0627 | 0.0295 | 0.0229 |         — |
| Toys    | graph   | 0.0613 | 0.0415 | 0.0898 | 0.0506 | 0.1233 | 0.0591 | 0.0439 |      1682 |
| Toys    | exact   | 0.0611 | 0.0414 | 0.0903 | 0.0508 | 0.1251 | 0.0596 | 0.0444 |         — |

## Practical notes

- `n_codebook` controls Semantic-ID length. The paper-best Sports and Toys
  recipes use 16 codebooks, Beauty uses 32, and the paper's long-ID
  CDs-and-Vinyl experiment uses 64.
- OPQ is trained only on items present in the training interactions, while the
  resulting tokenizer assigns codes to all items with supplied features.
- Content embeddings are part of the model recipe. Random features are useful
  for smoke tests but do not provide meaningful semantic IDs.
- Graph decoding is approximate and stochastic because its initial beam is
  sampled. Set `seed` for repeatability, or use exact scoring when deterministic
  full-catalog ranks are required.
